# Lexical-Grammar-Analysis
The project involves creating a parser for an Android layout description language. The project combines a context-free grammar specified in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) with a lexical analyzer generated using tools like Flex. The BNF grammar defines the structure and rules governing this language, specifying how Android layout elements and their attributes should be organized. The lexical analyzer recognizes individual tokens like element names, attributes, values, and punctuation based on the input language's syntax. The parser reads the tokens produced by the lexer and enforces the rules defined in the BNF, checking for proper element hierarchy, the presence of mandatory attributes, and adherence to the specified structure. Together, the BNF grammar and lexical analysis help ensure that Android layout descriptions are accurately and consistently interpreted, helping developers design user interfaces effectively.
